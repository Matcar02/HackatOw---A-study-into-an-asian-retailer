In this brief project, a colleague and I analyzed and predicted the customers behaviour of an asian healthcare retailer interested in assessing the effectiveness of its promotions and discounts.
The notebook is split into 3 sections:
1) Data cleaning and Prepration (wrangling).
2) Promos and Discounts insights.
3) Time-series Baseline sales forecasting.

It is not possible to share the data due to confidential agreements. Hope you enjoy!
